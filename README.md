# ZF1-Future for OPUS 4

The ZF1-Future library has been modified in order to support testing of OPUS 4 with PHPUnit 8.5. 
This allows running 
tests with PHP versions between 7.1 and 8.1. The library will be used to test and run OPUS 4.7.2 and following 
versions until the transition to Laminas is complete.
